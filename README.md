### What I learned

The biggest and most significant thing I learned was how to do the active state hover effect over the image. I had to tint the photo cyan and have the icon of the eye over it when the mouse hovered over the image. That took a very long time for me to get working correctly. I had to delete and redo things many times over. Eventually I watched a YouTube tutorial, which I try to avoid doing, and I still couldn't get it to work. That tutorial didn't make much sense to me. So I watched another one and finally found a way to do it that worked. It was such a relief, and an important skill for me to learn. It helped me practice positioning and play with the effects of opacity, both concepts that I needed more practice with.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue working on Newbie projects for a little while, but I'm going to start working on the more advanced ones in that level. The card component projects have been getting pretty easy for me for the most part, though I'm still learning important skills with them. I'd like to get better at nicer-looking responsive design and layout. I need to practice using grid more as well.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGbykdR4T8) - This is the video that helped me finally figure out the technique I used for the tinting photo hover effect.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) - I referenced this article to help refresh my memory on making smoother transitions for my active effects.
